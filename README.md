## About

The **Blue Economy Presidential Decision Game** challenges players to balance economic growth, environmental sustainability, and social welfare. Your policy choices will ripple through fisheries, shipping, marine conservation, and tourism ‚Äî will you leave behind prosperity or crisis?

In addition, the repo includes `mouse.py`, a **hand gesture-controlled virtual mouse** built with OpenCV, Mediapipe, and PyAutoGUI. This is a cool experimental tool for controlling your computer without touching the mouse.
